# ðŸŽ¨ Album Art Added

**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Change**: Album art now displays for all songs in both tabs

---

## What Was Added

### Album Art Integration
- **Source**: iTunes Search API (free, no authentication required)
- **Resolution**: 300x300 pixels
- **Caching**: Results cached for 1 hour to improve performance
- **Fallback**: Placeholder image if album art not found

---

## Where Album Art Appears

### Tab 1: Current Predictions
- Album art shown in each expandable song card
- 150px width
- Left column alongside prediction metrics

### Tab 2: Song Lookup
- Album art shown in search results
- 200px width
- Displayed when you search for a song

---

## How It Works

### iTunes API
1. Takes song title + artist name
2. Queries iTunes Search API
3. Fetches album artwork URL
4. Displays in Streamlit

### Caching
- Results cached for 1 hour (`@st.cache_data(ttl=3600)`)
- Reduces API calls
- Improves load times

### Fallback
- If song not found in iTunes: shows placeholder
- If API fails: shows placeholder
- Placeholder: "No Cover" image

## Example

**Song**: "The Fate Of Ophelia" by Taylor Swift
- âœ… Album art fetched from iTunes
- Displayed at 150px (Tab 1) or 200px (Tab 2)
- Cached for future views
